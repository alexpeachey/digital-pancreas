== Digital Pancreas

Digital Pancreas is a rails application designed to allow quick and easy tracking of blood glucose, insulin, carbohydrate intake, and exercise. It is designed for Type I Diabetics with the goal of eventually being able to recommend the best insulin doses.

It utilizes responsive design so it is as useful on your phone as your desktop.
